## [Project 1: Impact of Natural Disasters Based on Satellite Imagery](https://github.com/AarathiNadathur/Impact-of-natural-disaster-based-on-satellite-images)
* Created a interactive website using Python flask that shows the disaster images before and after the disaster occurs to measure the damage level.
* Dataset is prepared by image tiling and image masking techniques.
* Developed an efficient UNet model for detecting buildings and ResNet model to classify damage post disaster with 78% accuracy.
* Visualized data using interactive Tableau dashboards providing clear understanding of analysis. [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/dash1_15876322677990/Dashboard1?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)

## [Project 2: Stock Price Prediction - Chatbot TINA](https://github.com/AarathiNadathur/Stock-Market-Price-Prediction-Chatbot)
* The project is to understand and implement data mining techniques such that stakeholders can be benefited by getting the closely predicted closing price of a stock. It will help in taking better decisions for buying and selling stocks.  
* Predicting close price of stocks for next day based on historical data. Utilized ARIMA and LSTM for predicting prices.
* LSTM with MSE( error or deviation analysis) of 0.00066 yields better prediction than ARIMA(MSE- 0.041)
* Integrated a chatbot including Twitter Sentiment Analysis, Investor Sentiment Analysis, Prediction of Stock Price

## [Project 3: Image Recognition - Machine and Deep Learning](https://github.com/AarathiNadathur/cifar-100)
* Study performance of different classifiers on CIFAR-100 dataset. Worked on machine learning algorithms such as SVM,
Logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, random forests, decision tree algorithms to find most efficient algorithm.
* Performed binary classification of images in vehicle 1 and vehicle 2. The algorithm is tested against hiding 2 sub-classes image data during the training stage.
* Deep learning algorithm - CNN was implemented for image recognition and resulted an accuracy rate of 85%

## [Project 4: Tableau covid19](https://github.com/AarathiNadathur/Tableau-COVID19-Dashboard)
* Built an interactive dashboard showing the confirmed cases and casualties worldwide due to the virus. 
* Presented the top 10 countries having higher confirmed cases and casualties.
