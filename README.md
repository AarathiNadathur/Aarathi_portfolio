## [Project 1: Impact of Natural Disasters Based on Satellite Imagery](https://github.com/AarathiNadathur/Impact-of-natural-disaster-based-on-satellite-images)
* Created a interactive website using Python flask that shows the disaster images before and after the disaster occurs to measure the damage level.
* Dataset is prepared by image tiling and image masking techniques.
* Developed an efficient UNet model for detecting buildings and ResNet model to classify damage post disaster with 78% accuracy.
* Visualized data using interactive Tableau dashboards providing clear understanding of analysis. [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/dash1_15876322677990/Dashboard1?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)
